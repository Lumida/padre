# To encrypt a new string use something like the following:
#
# $ ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-password-file <password-file> -p
#
# Then take that output and place it (nicely formatted) into this file and
# then submit a pull request with that addition in it.
#
# For further information read:
#

#
# How do I read them
# ------------------
#
# Ask coworkers for the file(s) password via secure communications.
#
# Things to not do
# ----------------
#
# - Do **not** commit raw secrets files into github (even a local
#   fork or local branch or branch of a local fork).
# - Do **not** make a PR with raw secrets (files or other).
# - Do **not** merge a PR with raw secrets (files or other).
#
# Thanks, come again.
#
# Do note to decrypt is somewhat tricky (and hopefully gets better).
#
# Until it gets better look at: https://stackoverflow.com/q/43467180
